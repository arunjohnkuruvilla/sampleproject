Unlike other texts,  it begins with a detailed picture of the atom then builds toward  chemistryâ€™s frontier, continually demonstrating how to solve problems,  think about nature and matter, and visualize chemical concepts as  working chemists do. It also offers an exceptional level of support to  help students develop their mathemetical and problem-solving skills. "
